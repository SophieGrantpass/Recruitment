RECRUITMENT : A LIFE ROLLERCOSTER

Being a recruter... In the end what is it really ? 

Today I feel the urge to tell you about it because, many time, being a recruiter goes beyond what you expected. 

Yes, your day is paced by the same automatism that you know, you better keep them as a routine juste in case THE profil would appear. You check your overnight profiles, you look at your recent Linkedin contact, you try around many key words, booleans, magical formula to see if any new profile appear. 

This, you cannot escape because it is part of a recruiter habit. Meaning, that having a fresh look on the jobards / whatever platform you use is key. 

However, many events can rhythm your day, and soon makes you realize that when you became a recruiter, you jumped in a pool that will make you feel all the feelings. And that is, from what I believe, whats makes recruitment, exciting. Painful at some points, but bloody amazing at some extend. 

As naif at is seems, just being able to help 1) a person who's looking for a job, to get a job and get back on the train, and 2)to help a client who's also looking for someone and get them continue their projet is rewarding. Painfully, we still see that "meat market" and "meat hunting", are a reality. Nevertheless, let's not forget that we, recruiter, are not all working the same way, and aiming the same objectives. 

Basically, if you now wonder, what is a point of this article by the way ? 

It is an apology (short for sure, but still) to the recruitment. At some times, we get frustrated, we get angry, we get bored,... But what is more ? We are animated. 

Willing to go forward, explore new fields and new practices, share experiences and best practices. 



We are recruiters, and we should be proud.
